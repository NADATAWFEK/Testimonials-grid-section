                        fri intro course and found it icredibily fun! I enrolled shortlt thereafter. the next 12 weeks was the best -and
                        most grueling - time of my life. since completing the course, i have successfully switched careers , working as a software engineer
                        at a VR startup." </p>

                    <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure
                        from proffessionals who can help me learn programing step by step.
                         I was encouraged to enroll bya fromer student of theirs who can only say wonderfull things about the programe.
                         The intire curriculum and staff didn't disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait 
                         long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular , was outstanding.
                         It took my learning to the next level in away that no tutorial could ever have. In fact I,ve often referred to id during
                         interviews as an example of my developent experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer 
                         after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended. " </p>
